I am a recent graduate of the Political Science Master program at Central European University in Vienna. Currently, I am a research assistant at the Istanbul Policy Center. Previously, I held a couple of research assistant positions in academia and interned at national and international think tanks. Throughout these occasions, I gathered experience in conducting research, preparing and drafting written works, along with cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data in MS Excel, R and Python. If you are interested in my background and my previous experience, you can find more information on this website.
